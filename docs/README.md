This is a gimmick service developed to be a fun little thing for the Go community. The idea hit me when a fellow developer made a joke about the cascading errors in Go and thought that it would be nice to have leaderboards, an API, badges, etc. Other requests/proposals for the project are things like GitHub bots that do automatic PRs with the badge in the README file of Go projects.

You can use the service at [errnil.cpl.li](https://errnil.cpl.li) or obtain it yourself using `go get cpl.li/go/errnil/cmd/errnil`. Note that the service also has an API! (more on that at a later time).

Considering this project isn't anything too serious, I am not writing any documentation for the code, any contribution guide, etc. It's a fairly simple and standard Go project.
